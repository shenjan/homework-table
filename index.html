        <h3 dir="rtl">Early life</h3>
         
        <p>Dan Brown was born and raised in Exeter, New Hampshire, the eldest of three children. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter 
        Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997
        . Brown's parents are singers and musicians, having served as church choir masters, with his mother, Constance (Gerhard),
        serving as church organist. Brown was raised an Episcopalian, but has stated he had drifted away from Christianity 
        before finding a renewed interest in religion.</p>

        <p>After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing 
        a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as "Happy Frogs" and "Suzuki Elephants"; 
        it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled
        Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career
        as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.</p>
